I am a fourth-year Political Science PhD Candidate at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, studying Comparative Politics and Political Methodology. I earned my MA in Political Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill in 2025 and my BA in Political Science and Philosophy at Vanderbilt University in 2022.  I am a visiting doctoral student at the Universidad Diego Portales in Santiago, Chile, and a research affiliate at the [Eliminating Violence Against Women (E-VAW) Lab](https://kellogg.nd.edu/evaw-lab) at the University of Notre Dame.  

My research focuses on the political economy of migration, with a focus on Venezuelan migration to destinations in the Global South. My work uses both quantitative methods--observational data, surveys, and text analysis--and qualitative methods--focus groups and elite interviews. I have conducted fieldwork in Chile twice, and in Colombia three times.  My Master's Thesis, which won the 2025 Prothros Award for Best MA in the Department of Political Science, matches municipal-level observational data in Colombia with a survey of Venezuelan migrants to explore whether observed competition for public goods corresponds to migrants' feelings of integration. I have presented my work at conferences in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, and the United States.

I am part of the Chapel Hill Expert Survey - Latin America (CHES-LA) team, coordinated by [Jonathan Hartlyn](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/staff/jonathan-hartlyn/), [Cecilia Martínez-Gallardo](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/staff/cecilia-martinez-gallardo/), and [Nicolás de la Cerda](https://nicolasdelacerda.com/). The initial 2020-2021 wave surveyed 160 experts who evaluated 112 political parties and 13 presidents across 12 Latin American countries. The current 2024-2025 wave significantly expands coverage to 18 countries and broadens the scope to examine critical issues of populism and democratic commitment. Data from the first wave is publicly available at [www.chesdata.eu/chesla](www.chesdata.eu/chesla).

I am passionate about teaching and in 2025 I won the Wallace Award for Best Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in the Department of Political Science at UNC.  In the Fall of 2025, I will be independently teaching Introduction to Comparative Politics.
