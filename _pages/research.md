## Public Goods Competition and Migrants' Feelings of Integration: Evidence from Colombia
_2025 Winner of the James W. Prothro Award for the Best Master's Thesis in Political Science, UNC Chapel Hill_

Abstract: Does public goods competition impact migrants’ feelings of integration? Existing research on integration has focused on migration from developing countries to advanced industrial democracies. However, migration between developing countries is distinct: resource strain is more intense, state services are in higher demand, and cultural threats may be minimal. I argue that public goods competition is a key factor explaining intraregional migrants’ feelings of integration. I test this argument with the case of Venezuelan migration to Colombia. I combine public goods data for 140 Colombian municipalities with a survey of Venezuelan migrants. Using multilevel models, I find that Venezuelans in resource-abundant municipalities report more Colombian friends than those in resource-scarce areas. However, public goods competition does not explain other measures of integration. This study expands migration research by exploring integration in a context where migrants share the host society’s culture and highlights how subnational variation in state capacity impacts migratory experiences.

## Does Gender Mediate How Migrants' Access the State?
_Work in Progress_

Does gender mediate how migrants access (or do not access) the state in their destination countries, or their level of satisfaction with state services?  I conduct six single-gender focus groups with recent Venezuelan migrants living in two cities in Colombia. Results forthcoming.


## Social Unrest, Elite Cues and Support for Democracy: Evidence from Chile
_Work in Progress with Jaime Lindh_

Abstract: In the wake of social unrest, what role do elite cues have on changing citizens’ attitudes towards democracy? We conduct a text analysis of floor speeches of Chile's _Cámara de Diputados_ to show how right- and left-wing politicians shifted their rhetoric during and after the 2019 _estallido social_: politicians on the right started emphasizing law and order and calling for “mano dura” (strong hand, iron fist) punishments to those who destroyed property, while those on the left focused their attention on excessive use of force by the police. We then use a difference-in-differences design to examine changes in democratic attitudes among right- and left-wing citizens in Chile.  In accordance with elite cues, right-wing citizens supported democracy less after the _estallido social_.  However, contrary to what the elite cues literature suggests, left-wing citizens did not move at all in their support for democracy.
